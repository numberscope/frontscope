docs: Add Numberscope Description to README
# ================================================
# Subject                     50 CHARACTERS HERE ^
# 
# <type>(<scope>): <subject>
# <BLANK LINE>
# <body>
# <BLANK LINE>
# <footer>
# 
# * <type> is usually one of the following:
#   - fix             = bug fix             (patch in SemVer)
#   - feat            = new feature         (minor in SemVer)
#   - BREAKING CHANGE = breaking API change (major in SemVer)
# 
# * <type> can also be one of the following:
#   - build    = changes that affect the build system or external
#                dependencies (adding npm package, yarn package, etc.)
#   - ci       = changes to ci configuration files and scripts
#   - docs     = documentation only changes
#   - perf     = a code change that improves performance
#   - refactor = a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a
#                feature
#   - style    = changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
#                (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
#   - test     = adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
# 
# * <scope> will vary from project to project. If you're working on a
#   project that has a client and a server, it might make sense for a
#   commit that changes the server code to have have a scope of server.
#   Optional.
# 
# * <subject> should be capitalized as if it's an email header. It
#   should be no longer than 50 characters. It should use the
#   imperative, present tense.
# 
# * <body> should also use the imperative, present tense: "change" not
#   "changed" nor "changes". The body should include the motivation for
#   the change and contrast this with previous behavior. Focus on the
#   "what" and the "why" as opposed to the "how". Hard wrap at 72
#   characters. In Vi/Vim/Neovim, use `:set textwidth=72`
#   (`:set tw=72`) and `:set colorcolumn=72` (`:set cc=72`). Optional.
# 
# * <footer> should include a reference to an issue, if there's a
#   relevant issue. Optional.
