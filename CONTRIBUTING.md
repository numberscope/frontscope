# Contributing to Numberscope

## If you are new to software development, watch the video tutorials

Watch the video series on contributing to Numberscope [here](#). This video
series will introduce you to Numberscope, GitHub, the software we use in the
Numberscope project, and the workflow for contributing to Numberscope.

## If you have software dev experience, here's the TL;DR

1. Create a fork of the Numberscope repository you'd like to contribute to.
2. Create a branch within that repository.
3. Do your work on the branch you created. (Make sure your pre-commit hooks
   are working.)
4. When you think your code is in a good state, submit a pull request.
