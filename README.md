## What is Numberscope?

Numberscope is a tool for researchers, citizen-scientists, and artists.
Combine your favourite integer sequences with a suite of visualizers: online
tools that illustrate integer sequences and their properties. It is currently
in development.

## How do I use it?

The project will soon be establishing a public Numberscope server that you can
visit and experiment with. In the meantime, see
[Running from source](doc/running-from-source.md).

There's also a [User Guide](doc/user_guide.md) with information about how to
explore sequences with Numberscope.

## More information

-   [Extending Numberscope](doc/extending.md)

    Have a great idea for a new way to illustrate the behavior of an integer
    sequence? Numberscope is designed to make it easy to add new visualizers,
    and this guide will show you how.

    how you can have your work become part of the project.
