## What is Numberscope?

Numberscope is a tool for researchers, citizen-scientists, and artists.
Combine your favourite integer sequences with a suite of visualizers: online
tools that illustrate integer sequences and their properties. It is currently
in development.

## How do I use it?

The project will soon be extablishing a public Numberscope server that you can
visit and experiment with. In the meantime, see
[Running from source](doc/running-from-source.md).

There's also a [User Guide](doc/user_guide.md) with information about how to
explore sequences with Numberscope.

## More information

-   [Extending Numberscope](doc/extending.md)

    Have a great idea for a new way to illustrate the behavior of an integer
    sequence? Numberscope is designed to make it easy to add new visualizers,
    and this guide will show you how.

-   [Contributing](doc/contributing.md)

    More extensive information about all aspects of Numberscope's code, and
    how you can have your work become part of the project.
