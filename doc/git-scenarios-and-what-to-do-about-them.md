# Git scenarios and what to do about them

If you find yourself with a Git setup that isn't what Numberscope requires
(i.e. do your work in your own fork on a feature branch), you might be able to
use this guide to fix your setup.

Here are the different scenarios you could find yourself in and what to do
about them.
