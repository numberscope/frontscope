# Husky pre-commit actions

Assuming that the Git hooks specified by this repository have been
[installed](running-from-source.md), the
[Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) package will execute the following
actions prior to every call to `git commit`:

```sh
{! ../.husky/pre-commit extract: { start: list } !}
```

See the page on [package manager scripts](working-with-pm.md) for the meanings
of most of these actions.
