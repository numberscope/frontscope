# Building a Visualizer

We'll start with a general outline of creating visualizers, and then provide
some detailed examples and guidance.

## An overview of the process

#### Grab a template for your chosen graphics framework

The easiest way to build a visualizer is to extend a pre-made visualizer base
class, which automatically sets up a graphics framework for you to use. Right
now, there's only one base class available:

-   [`P5Visualizer`](#making-a-p5-visualizer-in-detail) uses the
    [**p5.js**](https://p5js.org/learn/) library for graphics and user
    interaction.

For a quick start, copy and modify the template file for your chosen
framework, which you can find in `src/visualizers-workbench`.

If you want to use a new graphics framework, you'll need to write your own
implementation of the [visualizer interface](behind-the-scenes.md).

#### Document as you write

Each visualizer has its documentation woven into the source code, using
special `/** md`&nbsp;‚Ä¶&nbsp;`**/` comments that are automatically compiled
into a [documentation page](../src/visualizers/Differences.md). We have some
[conventions](#how-to-document-your-visualizer) for what the documentation
comments should include and where in the source code they should go.

#### Develop your visualizer on the workbench

While you're working on a visualizer, we recommend keeping it in the
`src/visualizers-workbench` directory, where frontscope typically won't notice
it. To load it, run frontscope in "workbench mode" by calling
`npm run dev:workbench`.

When you're ready to propose your visualizer as an official part of
Numberscope, you'll move it to `src/visualizers`. Then frontscope will notice
and load it when you call the usual `npm run dev`. For details, see
[below](#where-to-put-your-visualizer).

A visualizer, like a work of art, is never really finished‚Äîeven when it's
accepted into Numberscope. Even the humble template visualizer discussed below
could be extended. You could shorten the infinite progress bar for finite
sequences, allow fast navigation by holding down arrow keys, add a progress
bar mouse-over that shows the index‚Ä¶ the possibilities are endless. We invite
you to try extending or enhancing existing Visualizers as well as building
your own. For now, though, let's return to the process of making a new
visualizer based on p5.

## Making a p5 visualizer, in detail

A good way to start a p5 visualizer is to copy and modify the basic example in
the `src/visualizers-workbench` directory:

-   `P5VisualizerTemplate.ts`

Let's look at the parts of a p5 visualizer. We recommend following along in
the visualizer template as you read.

#### üîëÔ∏è Name _(required)_

Put the visualizer's name in the static `category` property. A brief
description can also be provided. The name and description are used when
presenting visualizers to the user to choose from.

#### üí°Ô∏è Parameters _(often used)_

Parameters are the user-facing structures that ask for control values when a
visualizer is created. When someone running your visualizer sets a parameter
in the graphical interface (UI), its value is written to a corresponding
top-level property of the visualizer object. Conversely, if your code
internally changes one of those top-level properties while the visualizer is
running, you should refresh the corresponding parameter by calling
`this.refreshParams()` so the person interacting with it can see the change.

The parameters are described in the `paramDesc` object. A parameter must
specify a `default` value, a `type`, a name (`displayName`), and specify
whether it is `required` (required parameters are displayed more prominently).
Look in `src/shared/Paramable.ts`, or in other visualizers, to learn about the
other options you can set in `paramDesc`, such as longer descriptions.

-   **p5 Template:** `stepSize`.

#### üí°Ô∏è Other properties _(often used)_

You may also need internal data (top-level properties that are set and updated
while the visualizer is running, beyond the user's direct control). These
properties might do things like:

-   Keeping track of which part of the sequence you're looking at.
-   Storing colors that are created during setup.
-   Remembering where an animated object is.

By convention, we list these properties after `category` and `description`.

-   **p5 Template:** `index`.

#### üí°Ô∏è Determine validity of parameter values _(often used)_

There are three ways the validity of user input is checked. They are listed
here in order of preference.

The first is automatic type checking, based on the `type` property of a
parameter. Type errors are announced by the UI next to the relevant input
field.

The second is storing a function in the `validate` property of a parameter,
and such checks concern only that single parameter. For example, a parameter
typed as an integer may run a validation to check if the integer entered is
positive. Any errors on such checks will immediately be displayed to the user
next to the relevant parameter entry field.

The third is an opportunity to check global consistency among many parameters.
For example, it may be that the number of items in two separate list
parameters must be equal. Such checks can be performed in the function
`checkParameters()`, which is called whenever parameters are changed by the
user, giving you a chance to check the parameter values and prompt the user to
correct any invalid ones. Errors generated by such checks are displayed at the
top of the parameters panel, and may be less immediately visible to the user,
for which reason these should be avoided if type-checking or the `validate`
property will suffice.

By the time checkParameters() is called, the visualizer's sequence should be
sufficiently initialized that you can depend on its `first` and `last` (index)
values, in case you need those for validation. On the other hand, the sketch
will not necessarily yet be available. You can do sketch-dependent validation
in [`setup()`](#set-up-the-visualizer-often-used), as described below, but you
won't be able to prompt the user for corrections at that point.

-   **p5 Template:** Make sure that the step size is positive.

#### üî©Ô∏è Inhabit a page element _(advanced)_

Each time the visualizer is inserted into a page element, the `inhabit()`
function is called, giving you access to the element the visualizer is about
to inhabit. If you don't need information from the web page your visualizer is
running in, or access to its document object model (DOM), you shouldn't need
to implement `inhabit()`. The full details on this method are in the
[visualizer interface](behind-the-scenes.md) documentation.

#### üí°Ô∏è Handle aspect ratio _(often used)_

By default, a visualizer does not set its own sketch dimensions (width and
height). Instead, the Numberscope UI assigns these dimensions, providing the
visualizer with the largest available canvas for the user's setup.  
After `setup()` is run, the dimensions are stored in `this.sketch.width` and
`this.sketch.height` and the visualizer should handle all its drawing with
respect to these.

In some cases, a visualizer design may run best in a fixed aspect ratio, such
as a square canvas. In this case, you can request a specific aspect ratio by
implementing `requestedAspectRatio()` to return the ratio as a number
representing width/height. In this case, the UI will provide a canvas of the
maximal size with that ratio.

#### üí°Ô∏è Set up the visualizer _(often used)_

There are two places to do pre-computation before the sketch begins looping
through frames of the drawing. The first is `presketch()`, which runs
asynchronously, meaning that the browser will not be blocked while this
function completes. This is not a part of p5.js, but a part of Numberscope.
The `presketch()` function is called by the framework with one argument,
representing the size of the canvas to be created as a ViewSize object with
number fields `width` and `height`.

If you implement `presketch()`, begin by calling
`await super.presketch(size)`, which will initialize the sequence. After this
call, you have access to the sequence, so you can do sequence-dependent
validation and initialization here. You do have the opportunity to set up
private state variables. For example, this is a good place to populate an
array with time-consuming precomputed values you will use repeatedly during
the sketch. However, you still have no access to the p5 canvas or the
`this.sketch` object.

Note also that `presketch()` is called when there is a new visualizer, when
the sequence changes, when you visit a new Numberscope URL, but not when
visualizer parameters change or the screen is resized. So if there is
initialization you want to do only on these more signifcant changes but not on
parameter changes or resizes, then `presketch()` is a good method.

The next opportunity is when the p5 graphics context becomes available, which
occurs after `presketch()` completes. At this time, `setup()` is called,
giving you your first chance to set graphics options and draw on the canvas.
For example, p5 colors cannot be dealt with in `presketch()`, but can be set
up here. This is a good place for one-time graphics operations, like painting
the background of a static visualizer or setting colors and stroke options
that won't change from frame to frame.

If you implement `setup()`, start by calling `super.setup()`, which includes
the [`createCanvas()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createCanvas) call that
must appear in every p5 setup function.

When a visualizer is resized, or the restart button on Numberscope is pressed,
the class function `reset()` is called. By default, this calls `setup()` but
not `presketch()`, and a new canvas is created. However, the visualizer object
constructor is not re-run and any data stored in variables in the visualizer
object persists. Those defaults mean that you have the option to forgo
re-doing expensive pre-computations: if they don't need sketch access, you can
put such calculations in `presketch()`. For even greater customization of what
happens when, you can override/extend `reset()` from the `P5Visualizer` base
class, or you can define a `resized()` method for behavior that only occurs
when the canvas is resized. Note that in this latter case, if you do want
`reset()` to occur on resize, you will need to call it yourself, as the
presence of a `resized()` method replaces the default behavior.

-   **p5 Template:** Go to the beginning of the sequence. Create palette
    colors. Set text alignment.

#### üî©Ô∏è Show or stop the visualization; depart from a page element _(advanced)_

You shouldn't frequently need to implement `show()`, `stop()`, or `depart()`.
You can learn about them from the [visualizer interface](behind-the-scenes.md)
documentation, and from how they're implemented in the `P5Visualizer` base
class.

#### üîëÔ∏è Draw the visualization _(required)_

The `draw()` function is called on each frame, giving you a chance to draw
your visualization! Look at the examples and the p5
[tutorials](https://p5js.org/learn/) and
[p5.js reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) to learn about what you can do.

Drawing tools and options are found in the graphics context, `this.sketch`.
Accessing `this.sketch` triggers some consistency checks, so we recommend
storing its value as a local constant in each function call that uses it. This
avoids redundant checks.

Sequence information is found in `this.seq`. This is a `SequenceInterface`
object, so it will always have a method `getElement(n)` that returns the `n`th
entry in the sequence.

You have to implement the `draw()` method, even if it does nothing. Your
visualizer can't be loaded into Numberscope without it.

#### üí°Ô∏è Stop and start animation _(often used)_

If your visualization is a static picture, call the visualizer `stop()` method
when you're done drawing. This stops the p5 animation loop, so you don't waste
time re-drawing the same picture dozens of times per second. If the
visualization is only static temporarily, you can call `continue()` to
re-start the animation loop whenever you need to.

If you have previous experience with p5.js, you might be used to calling
`noLoop()` and `loop()` to stop and start your sketch. In a visualizer,
however, you need to use its `stop()` and `continue()` methods to ensure that
all of Numberscope's controls remain properly updated.

As an advanced option, `stop()` can also take a maximum number of additional
frames to draw. So if you you only want your visualization to run for 100
frames, you could just call `this.stop(100)` right in your `setup()` function.

-   **p5 Template:** Stop the animation loop at the end of each frame. Only
    start it again when the user steps to a different sequence entry,
    requiring the picture to be re-drawn.

#### üí°Ô∏è Respond to user interactions _(often used)_

Each time the user interacts with your visualization, an
[event handling](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Events) function like
`keyPressed()` or `mouseClicked()` will be called, giving you a chance to
respond. There are handlers for a wide variety of input events.

#### üîëÔ∏è How to make your visualizer available _(required)_

The engine expects the visualizer to be packaged in a `VisualizerExportModule`
object, constructed from the visualizer class and a short description string.
This "export" happens after the class definition.

#### üî©Ô∏è How to handle errors _(advanced)_

There are two ways to let people interacting with a visualizer know that
something unexpected has happened. The first is with the
[alertMessage](../src/shared/alertMessage.md) utility. The second is to just
throw an error. If it's not caught anywhere else, the visualizer framework
will show it in an error dialog.

#### üî©Ô∏è Getting random numbers _(advanced)_

Do not use the built-in `Math.random()` random number generator, because there
is no practical mechanism for making its output reproducible for testing
purposes. Instead, obtain random numbers using the provided `math` module,
along the following lines:

```
import {math} from '@/shared/math'
import {P5Visualizer} from '@/visualizers/P5Visualizer'

class DiceVisualizer extends P5Visualizer({}) {
    ...
    draw() {
        ...
        // Roll a die (generate a number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6,
        // all equally likely, at random):
        const myRoll = math.randomInt(1, 7)  // upper limit is exclusive.
        ...
```

For more details, see the [math documentation](../src/shared/math.md).

### How to document your visualizer

Documentation should be included in the source file between markdown tags
`/** md` and `**/`. This will be scraped from the source and automatically
compiled into the online documentation. The p5 Template visualizer
demonstrates our documentation conventions. That template also includes other
helpful comments marked with `// ===`; these are not compiled into the online
documentation and are only provided in the template to augment this guide (you
need not imitate this).  
You should also provide any additional code documentation in place as you
normally would.

#### Name, sample image, and description

In a documentation block just before the visualizer class definition, put a
level-1 heading with the visualizer's name, followed by a sample image and a
description.

To make the sample image, take a screenshot of your visualizer and put it in
the `src/assets/img<VisualizerName>` directory. Add the image to the
documentation page as shown in the examples, using the `width` property for
scaling.

Below the sample image, describe what the visualizer does. Please be precise
about exactly how the image is created from the terms of the sequence.

#### Parameters

In a documentation block just before definition of `params`, put "Parameters"
in a level-2 heading. Inside the definition of `params`, just before each the
parameter's key, put a documentation block that displays like this:

> **Parameter name:** Description of the parameter. _(Type and constraints.)_

#### Controls

If users can interact with your visualizer while it's running, these
interactions should be documented too. In a documentation block just before
the first event handling method, put "Controls" in a level-2 heading. Display
control information like this:

> **Key or gesture:** Description of effect.

You can organize the control documentation comments in whatever way makes the
most sense. If possible, order the event handling methods so that most
controls can be documented near the method that implements them.

#### Additional documentation

Any additional documentation should go in documentation comments after all of
the event handling methods. This is the place for in-depth discussions,
example settings, image galleries, credits, and so forth.

Code-related documentation, like explanations of algorithms used in the
visualizer, should go as close as possible to the related code. This means, in
particular, that code requiring additional documentation should come after the
event handling methods if possible.

#### Export block

The `VisualizerExportModule` block should be the last thing in the visualizer
source file. That makes it easy to find.

## Where to put your visualizer

However you made it, when a visualizer is ready for Numberscope users, place
the file containing its class definition and export module in the folder
`src/visualizers`. When the frontscope client runs, it'll find your visualizer
and compile it at runtime.

If running `npm run dev`, visualizers in `src/visualizers` will be available.
As discussed [earlier](#develop-your-visualizer-on-the-workbench), visualizers
that aren't ready for Numberscope users should go in
`src/visualizers-workbench`. You can load them (and the P5Template visualizer
discussed in this guide) to see how they work by running with
`npm run dev:workbench`.
