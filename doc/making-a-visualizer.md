# Building a Visualizer

We'll start with a general outline of creating visualizers, and then provide
some detailed examples and guidance.

## An overview of the process

#### Grab a template for your chosen graphics framework

The easiest way to build a visualizer is to extend a pre-made visualizer base
class, which automatically sets up a graphics framework for you to use. Right
now, there's only one base class available:

-   [`P5Visualizer`](#making-a-p5-visualizer-in-detail) uses the
    [**p5.js**](https://p5js.org/learn/) library for graphics and user
    interaction.

For a quick start, copy and modify the template file for your chosen
framework, which you can find in `src/visualizers-workbench`.

If you want to use a new graphics framework, you'll need to write your own
implementation of the [visualizer interface](behind-the-scenes.md).

#### Document as you write

Each visualizer has its documentation woven into the source code, using
special `/** md`&nbsp;‚Ä¶&nbsp;`**/` comments that are automatically compiled
into a [documentation page](../src/visualizers/Differences.md). We have some
[conventions](#how-to-document-your-visualizer) for what the documentation
comments should include and where in the source code they should go.

#### Develop your visualizer on the workbench

While you're working on a visualizer, we recommend keeping it in the
`src/visualizers-workbench` directory, where frontscope typically won't notice
it. To load it, run frontscope in "workbench mode" by calling
`npm run dev:workbench`.

When you're ready to propose your visualizer as an official part of
Numberscope, you'll move it to `src/visualizers`. Then frontscope will notice
and load it when you call the usual `npm run dev`. For details, see
[below](#where-to-put-your-visualizer).

A visualizer, like a work of art, is never really finished‚Äîeven when it's
accepted into Numberscope. Even the humble template visualizer discussed below
could be extended. You could shorten the infinite progress bar for finite
sequences, allow fast navigation by holding down arrow keys, add a progress
bar mouse-over that shows the index‚Ä¶ the possibilities are endless. We invite
you to try extending or enhancing existing Visualizers as well as building
your own. For now, though, let's return to the process of making a new
visualizer based on p5.

## Making a p5 visualizer, in detail

A good way to start a p5 visualizer is to copy and modify one of the basic
examples in the `src/visualizers-workbench` directory:

-   `P5VisualizerTemplate.ts`
-   `Differences.ts`

Let's look at the parts of a p5 visualizer. We recommend following along in
one of the basic examples as you read.

#### üîëÔ∏è Name _(required)_

Put the visualizer's name in the static `visualizationName` property. The name
is used in the visualizer list and the titles of bundle cards.

#### üí°Ô∏è Parameters _(often used)_

Parameters are the user-facing structures that ask for control values when a
visualizer is created. When someone running your visualizer sets a parameter
in the graphical interface (UI), its value is written to a corresponding
top-level property of the visualizer object. Conversely, if your code
internally changes one of those top-level properties while the visualizer is
running, you should refresh the corresponding parameter by calling
`this.refreshParams()` so the person interacting with it can see the change.

Below the list of these parameter properties, the visualizer class also needs
a `params` property that describes how the parameters should appear in the UI.
Look in `src/shared/Paramable.ts`, or in other visualizers, to learn about the
options you can set in the `params` property -- labels for the parameter,
allowed values for a dropdown menu, and so on.

-   **p5 Template:** `stepSize`.
-   **Differences:** `n`, `levels`. This visualizer uses `refreshParams()`
    when it auto-fills the optional parameter `levels`.

#### üí°Ô∏è Other properties _(often used)_

You may also need internal data (top-level properties that are set and updated
while the visualizer is running, beyond the user's direct control). These
properties might do things like:

-   Keeping track of which part of the sequence you're looking at.
-   Storing colors that are created during setup.
-   Remembering where an animated object is.

By convention, we list these properties after the `params` property.

-   **p5 Template:** `index`.
-   **Differences:** `first`.

#### üí°Ô∏è Determine if parameters are consistent _(often used)_

When the user clicks "save", `checkParameters()` is called, giving you a
chance to check the parameter values and prompt the user to correct any
invalid ones.

Your validation can't depend on the sequence, because there might not be any
sequence loaded when the validation check runs. You can do sequence-dependent
validation in [`setup()`](#set-up-the-visualizer-often-used), as described
below, but you won't be able to prompt the user for corrections at that point.

-   **p5 Template:** Make sure that the step size is positive.
-   **Differences:** Make sure that the number of terms is positive or zero,
    the number of levels is positive, and the number of terms is at least the
    number of levels.

#### üî©Ô∏è Inhabit a page element _(advanced)_

Each time the visualizer is inserted into a page element, the `inhabit()`
function is called, giving you access to the element the visualizer is about
to inhabit. If you don't need information from the web page your visualizer is
running in, or access to its document object model (DOM), you shouldn't need
to implement `inhabit()`. The full details on this method are in the
[visualizer interface](behind-the-scenes.md) documentation.

#### üí°Ô∏è Set up the visualizer _(often used)_

When the p5 graphics context becomes available, `setup()` is called, giving
you your first chance to set graphics options and draw on the canvas. This is
a good place for one-time graphics operations, like painting the background of
a static visualizer or setting colors and stroke options that won't change
from frame to frame.

If you implement `setup()`, start by calling `super.setup()`, which includes
the [`createCanvas()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createCanvas) call that
must appear in every p5 setup function.

When `setup()` is called, the visualizer will always be attached to a
sequence, so you can do sequence-dependent validation and initialization here.

-   **p5 Template:** Go to the beginning of the sequence. Create palette
    colors. Set text alignment.
-   **Differences:** Fill in the default value of the `levels` property if it
    was left unset in the parameters dialog. Do a consistency check between
    the sequence being visualized and the parameters.

#### üî©Ô∏è Show or stop the visualization; depart from a page element _(advanced)_

You shouldn't need to implement `show()`, `stop()`, or `depart()`. You can
learn about them from the [visualizer interface](behind-the-scenes.md)
documentation, and from how they're implemented in the `P5Visualizer` base
class.

#### üîëÔ∏è Draw the visualization _(required)_

The `draw()` function is called on each frame, giving you a chance to draw
your visualization! Look at the examples and the p5
[tutorials](https://p5js.org/learn/) and
[p5.js reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) to learn about what you can do.

Drawing tools and options are found in the graphics context, `this.sketch`.
Accessing `this.sketch` triggers some consistency checks, so we recommend
storing its value as a local constant in each function call that uses it. This
avoids redundant checks.

Sequence information is found in `this.seq`. This is a `SequenceInterface`
object, so it will always have a method `getElement(n)` that returns the `n`th
entry in the sequence.

You have to implement the `draw()` method, even if it does nothing. Your
visualizer can't be loaded into Numberscope without it.

#### üí°Ô∏è Stop and start animation _(often used)_

If your visualization is a static picture, call the sketch's `noLoop()`
function when you're done drawing. This stops the animation loop, so you don't
waste time re-drawing the same picture dozens of times per second. If the
visualization is only static temporarily, you can call `loop()` to re-start
the animation loop whenever you need to.

-   **p5 Template:** Stop the animation loop at the end of each frame. Only
    start it again when the user steps to a different sequence entry,
    requiring the picture to be re-drawn.
-   **Differences:** Draw the whole visualization in one frame, and then stop
    the animation loop.

#### üí°Ô∏è Respond to user interactions _(often used)_

Each time the user interacts with your visualization, an
[event handling](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Events) function like
`keyPressed()` or `mouseClicked()` will be called, giving you a chance to
respond. There are handlers for a wide variety of input events.

#### üîëÔ∏è How to make your visualizer available _(required)_

The engine expects the visualizer to be packaged in a `VisualizerExportModule`
object, constructed from the visualizer class and a short description string.
This "export" happens after the class definition.

#### üî©Ô∏è How to handle errors _(advanced)_

There are two ways to let people interacting with a visualizer know that
something unexpected has happened. The first is with the
[alertMessage](../src/shared/alertMessage.md) utility. The second is to just
throw an error. If it's not caught anywhere else, the visualizer framework
will show it in an error dialog.

### How to document your visualizer

The p5 Template visualizer and the Differences visualizer both follow our
documentation conventions.

#### Name, sample image, and description

In a documentation block just before the visualizer class definition, put a
level-1 heading with the visualizer's name, followed by a sample image and a
description.

To make the sample image, take a screenshot of your visualizer and put it in
the `src/assets/img<VisualizerName>` directory. Add the image to the
documentation page as shown in the examples, using the `width` property for
scaling.

Below the sample image, describe what the visualizer does.

#### Parameters

In a documentation block just before definition of `params`, put "Parameters"
in a level-2 heading. Inside the definition of `params`, just before each the
parameter's key, put a documentation block that displays like this:

> **Parameter name:** Description of the parameter. _(Type and constraints.)_

#### Controls

If users can interact with your visualizer while it's running, these
interactions should be documented too. In a documentation block just before
the first event handling method, put "Controls" in a level-2 heading. Display
control information like this:

> **Key or gesture:** Description of effect.

You can organize the control documentation comments in whatever way makes the
most sense. If possible, order the event handling methods so that most
controls can be documented near the method that implements them.

#### Additional documentation

Any additional documentation should go in documentation comments after all of
the event handling methods. This is the place for in-depth discussions,
example settings, image galleries, credits, and so forth.

Code-related documentation, like explanations of algorithms used in the
visualizer, should go as close as possible to the related code. This means, in
particular, that code requiring additional documentation should come after the
event handling methods if possible.

#### Export block

The `VisualizerExportModule` block should be the last thing in the visualizer
source file. That makes it easy to find.

## Where to put your visualizer

However you made it, when a visualizer is ready for Numberscope users, place
the file containing its class definition and export module in the folder
`src/visualizers`. When the frontscope client runs, it'll find your visualizer
and compile it at runtime.

The visualizers in `src/visualizers` will appear as options when you start
Numberscope with `npm run dev` as usual.

As discussed [earlier](#develop-your-visualizer-on-the-workbench), visualizers
that aren't ready for Numberscope users should go in
`src/visualizers-workbench`. You can load them to see how they work by running
with `npm run dev:workbench`.
