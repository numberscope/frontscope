# User guide

From the Numberscope landing page, you can access the visualization tool
itself with either of the buttons mentioning "the 'Scope." (There's one in the
top navigation bar and one right in the center of the page for convenience.)
That will bring you to:

{! ../src/views/Scope.vue extract: { start: '<!-- md', stop: '^\s*-->'} !}

## Errors

If Numberscope experiences an error, you might see an alert with the error
message. If you see one that does not resolve upon reloading the page and
trying again, please let us know about the problem by [filing an issue
on GitHub](https://github.com/numberscope/frontscope/ issues/new). Please
describe as thoroughly as you can what you were doing when the alert ocurred
and what it said -- a screenshot could be helpful. Thanks!
