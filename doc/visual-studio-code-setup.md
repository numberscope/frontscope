# Visual Studio Code

VS Code is pretty easy to set up for Numberscope development. Follow these steps
and you'll be coding in no time!

1. Install VS Code. How exactly you do this will depend on what operating
   system you use. Try the following link and follow the setup guide for your
   operating system:
    - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview
2. Once you've installed VS Code, you'll want to install the following
   extensions (make sure you get the exact same ones as below):
    - Code Spell Checker
    - Prettier - Code formatter
    - TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)
    - Vue Language Features (Volar)
      For more info on extensions, see:

3. Install any other extensions you might want. If you like Vim keybindings,
   try the Vim extension. There are also lots of Emacs extensions. There are a
   lot of color themes as well.
