# Gitting it right

If you find yourself with a Git setup that isn't what Numberscope requires
(i.e. do your work in your own fork on a feature branch), you might be able to
use this guide to fix your setup.

Here are the different scenarios you could find yourself in and what to do
about them.

-   1: You have a clone of a Numberscope repository.
    -   1.A: You haven't made changes.
        -   [Create a fork](./working-with-git-and-github.md#create-a-fork).
        -   [Clone your fork](./working-with-git-and-github.md#clone-a-repo).
        -   [Create a branch](./working-with-git-and-github.md#create-a-branch).
        -   [Push a branch](./working-with-git-and-github.md#push-a-branch).
        -   Now you are working in your own fork on a dedicated feature
            branch, congrats! Read about about basic Git operations below and
            get to work making a cool visualizer!
        -   [Read about basic Git operations](./working-with-git-and-github.md#basic-git-operations).
    -   1.B: You have made changes.
        -   1.B.1: You are working on the main branch.
            -   1.B.1.A: You made commits.
                -   Ask someone at Numberscope for help
            -   1.B.1.B: You haven't made commits.
            -   [Stash your changes](./working-with-git-and-github.md#stash-your-changes).
            -   [Create a branch](./working-with-git-and-github.md#create-a-branch).
            -   [Create a fork](./working-with-git-and-github.md#create-a-fork).
            -   [Add the remote of your fork](./working-with-git-and-github.md#add-a-remote).
            -   [Push the branch to your fork](./working-with-git-and-github.md#push-a-branch).
            -   [Clone your fork](./working-with-git-and-github.md#clone-a-repo).
