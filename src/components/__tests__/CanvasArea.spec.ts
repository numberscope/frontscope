    If we try to import CanvasArea, we get an error when we do

    TypeError: document.hasFocus is not a function

    The test suite isn't providing the document object. I'll leave this file 
    as a placeholder. Maybe we'll figure out a way to test this in the future.

    The dead code below is what we should test if/when we can import CanvasArea.
